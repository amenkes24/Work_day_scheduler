# Work Day Scheduler

A daily planner that lets you add events to allow one to manage time effectively.

* WHEN you open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

* WHEN you scroll down THEN you am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

* WHEN you view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

* WHEN you click into a time block THEN you can enter an event

* WHEN you click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

* WHEN you refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
